**Aim:** 
Extending the capabilities of U-ASK, a system for processing spatial-keyword queries that can handle negative keyword predicates

`
Negative keyword predicates in the context of spatial-keyword queries refer to conditions that specify keywords which should not be present in the query results. 
For instance, if a user is searching for restaurants and wants to exclude those that serve a particular type of cuisine, the unwanted cuisine type would be specified as a negative keyword predicate. 
This allows for more refined search results by not only looking for matches based on positive criteria (e.g., location, keywords of interest) but also by excluding results that contain specified negative keywords.
