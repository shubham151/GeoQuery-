# **GeoQuery+ (U-ASK: Enhanced Spatial-Keyword Query Processing)

U-ASK is a unified indexing and query processing system designed for kNN spatial-keyword queries that support negative keyword predicates, as presented in ACM SIGSPATIAL 2022. This project aims to extend U-ASK to handle various types of spatial-keyword queries.

## Project Objectives

- Implement the technique presented in the U-ASK paper and reproduce the reported results.
- Add a module using similar indexing to support spatial-keyword Boolean range queries and/or collective spatial-keyword queries.
- Ensure that all newly supported queries filter negative query keywords.
- Evaluate the new queries against state-of-the-art relevant algorithms using the same parameters and evaluation measures from the original paper. Consult with the TA and instructor for any doubts about experimental evaluation.
- Write an updated paper (project report) based on the enhanced technique. The paper should provide detailed descriptions of the new algorithms, including illustrations, figures, examples, and pseudo-code, along with experimental results. The level of detail should be sufficient for readers to reproduce the new module and its presented results.

## Tips

- Create a clear plan at the beginning to divide the work among team members within the project time period.
- Start by concurrently reading the U-ASK paper and reviewing recent literature on spatial-keyword search. Design the new algorithm, implement it, experiment with it, and finally, write the project report.

## U-ASK Paper

**Title:** U-ASK: a unified architecture for kNN spatial-keyword queries supporting negative keyword predicates.

**Authors:** Yongyi Liu, Amr Magdy.

**Conference:** SIGSPATIAL/GIS 2022.

**Pages:** 40:1-40:11.

## Project Deliverables

1. **Source Code:**
   - Clean and modular implementation of your algorithm.
   - A clear README file explaining how to run experiments end-to-end, including any libraries or dependencies.

2. **Project Report:**
   - A written paper in two versions:
     - PDF version
     - Source document (WORD document or Latex project).
   - Preferred format: ACM or IEEE conferences format.
   - Include detailed information on the new algorithms, with illustrations, examples, and pseudo-code.
   - Present experimental results with the same parameters and measures used in the original paper.
